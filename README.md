🎓 Smart Campus Management System
🔹 Overview

A Flask-based backend application to automate campus services like:

🍴 Canteen Meal Prediction – reduce food wastage

🎒 Lost & Found Tracking – easy reporting & retrieval

🎓 Scholarship Eligibility – rule-based prediction

📝 Student Feedback – structured storage & analysis

🔹 My Contribution

✅ Built RESTful APIs with Flask + Blueprints (MVC structure)

✅ Designed MySQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM

✅ Optimized queries → API response time <200ms

✅ Added JWT authentication for secure access

✅ Integrated ML model with API routes for real-time predictions

🔹 Tech Stack

Backend: Python (Flask), SQLAlchemy

Database: MySQL

Authentication: JWT Tokens

Machine Learning: Pandas, Scikit-learn

Architecture: RESTful API (modular with Blueprints)

🔹 Workflow (Backend Focused)

📱 User sends request (JSON) via app

🌐 Flask API receives & routes request

🔑 JWT authentication validates user

🗄️ SQLAlchemy queries MySQL database

🤖 ML model runs prediction (if required)

⚡ API responds in JSON under 200ms
